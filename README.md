# Automated ABC–XYZ Sales Analysis

This project performs an automated ABC–XYZ analysis of sales data using Python.

## What the script does
- Cleans raw sales data
- Calculates product revenue
- Performs ABC classification based on cumulative sales share
- Performs XYZ classification based on sales volatility
- Combines both into an ABC–XYZ matrix
- Generates Excel reports and visualizations

## Output
- ABC_XYZ_results.xlsx – full classification of products
- class_summary.xlsx – revenue by ABC–XYZ class
- abc_xyz_classes.png – distribution of classes
- abc_pareto.png – Pareto curve for ABC classification

## Business insight
The analysis shows a strong Pareto effect – a small number of products (class A) generate the majority of revenue.
Products classified as AX should be prioritized in inventory planning, while CZ and BZ products are candidates for stock reduction.
